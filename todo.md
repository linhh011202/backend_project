1. CRUD any kind of thing. Eg: book, product, ... (input validation required)
 - Create a new table
 - Create endpoint using REST
 - Each request must validate input to ensure that it is valid
 - Each user can only view their rows. Admin can view all rows
2. Implement global guard
3. Review project to understand deeply about structure
